# Sorting algorithm

Sorting algorithms are useful in many applications, such as scheduling, operations research, numerical computations, event-driven simulation, etc.

Writing an efficient sorting algorithm is very important for optimizing the efficiency of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) that require input data to be in sorted lists. 

## Requirements

Evaluate and compare the performance of the BubbleSort and MergeSort algorithms concerning time efficiency across various types of vectors. The vector size is a command-line argument.

# Rational

A rational number is a number that can be expressed as the quotient $\frac{p}{q}$ of two integers, a numerator $p$ and a non-zero denominator $q$.

## Example 

p = 1, q = 2

the rational number is: 1 / 2 = 0.5.

## Requirements

Write a program which creates a Rational class and implements the following operations:

- writing a rational number on the standard output in the following format : **numerator / denominator**;
- defining the operators **+**, **\***;
- defining a function that converts a rational number into a floating-point number.

# Input/Output

## Exercise 1: The sum of square of the first N positive integers

Write a program which reads the first $N$ positive integers from the file **data.csv** of the following format:
```text
# Values
1
2

3
4
5
6
7
```
in which the character `#` represent a line to be ignored (the header of the file).

 1. The file contains a list with the first N positive integers. Sum the squares of these values and print the result on the standard output.
 2. Write a function that given an integer N returns the value $$ S = \frac{N(N+1)(2N + 1)}{6}.$$
 3. Compare the two obtained results.
